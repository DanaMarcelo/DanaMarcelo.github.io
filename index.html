<p>Welcome to my website</p>
<p>here are some random facts:</p>

<p>Who invented the internet? 
  Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989, about 20 years after the first connection was established over 
  what is today known as the Internet. At the time, Tim was a software engineer at CERN, the large particle physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland.</p>

<p>when was the wireless phone invented?
A jazz musician named Teri Pall invented a version of the cordless phone in 1965 but could not market her invention, 
  as its 2-mile (3.2 km) range caused its radio signals to interfere with aircraft communications. 
  In 1968, she sold her rights to the cordless phone to a manufacturer who modified it for practical use.</p>
