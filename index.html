<h1>Dana's Term 4 Article</h1>
<p>Welcome to my Website.</p>
<p>This "website" is about Camouflage.</p>

<p>Introduction:</p>

<p>In this article, I will be showing you about Types of camo, animal examples and lots of pictures, human camo, and other people that use it. </p>

<p>In order to survive, animals use camouflage to hunt for food and hide from predators.</p>

<p>There are four types of camouflage:</p>

<p>1. Concealing Colouration</p>

<p>2.Distruptive Colouration</p>

<p>3. Disguise</p>

<p>4. Mimicry</p>

<p>
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>Consealing Colouration</p>

<p>Conealing colouration is when an animals body is the same colour as its surroundings. Examples such as snowy owls, polarbears, lions and camels use this type of camouflage:</p>

<p>Disruptive Colouration</p>

<p>Disruptive Colouration is when an animal has stripes, spots or any pattern on its body. Is a form of camouflage that works by breaking up the outlines of an animal.</p>

<p>can you spot the geraffe?</p>

<p>Did you know that zebras actualy blend in with themselvs? That's why thay're always in huge herds, to confuse the predators.</p>

<p>Disguise </p>

<p>When creatures are disguised, they confuse predators or prey to look like objects like a leaf or a stick.</p>

<p>Some examples: (flounder, thorn bug, leaf katydid.)</p>

<p>Mimicry</p>

<p>Mimicry is when an animal looks similar to another creature.</p>

<p>The viceroy butterfly mimics the monarch butterfly to so that predators will avoid them.                                                            
They actualy taste much better than the monarch butterfly.</p>

<p>Changing Colour. Stoats change the colour of their fur by molting depending on the on the season.</p>

<p>Chameleons- In addition to being responsive to light, chameleons change color when they are frightened and in response to temperature and other environmental changes. Hormones that affect special pigment-bearing cells in the skin cause the color change. Its color does not always change to match its surroundings, however, as is commonly believed.</p>

<p>Cuttlefish change colour on not what's around them but what's underneath them. Scientists already knew that the cuttlefish has pigmented organs called chromatophores, which allow the creature to change its color to blend into its environment (and thus evade predators)</p>

<p>Definition: Chromatophores are pigment-containing and light-reflecting cells, or groups of cells, found in a wide range of animals including amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and cephalopods. Mammals and birds, in contrast, have a class of cells called melanocytes for coloration.</p>

<p>Here is an octopus :)</p>

<p>Being Transparent</p>

<p>These animals don’t have any teeth, claws or toxins to protect themselvs from menacing predators. So, these transparent animals camouflage themselves by baring all.</p>

<p>Ghost srimp.
Also known as the Glass Shrimp, this translucent crustacean is a popular pet. Its natural habitat is in the brackish water of wetlands, where it is a skilled scavenger.</p>

<p>Glass Wing Butterfly. Native to Columbia, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador, the Glasswing butterfly features huge transparent wing panels. The Spanish name ‘espejitos’ means ‘little mirrors’. Adult glasswing butterflies will often migrate great distances, and males are known to lek, or gather in large groups for the purpose of competitive mating displays.</p>

<p>Glass Frog. This amazing amphibian has a transparent under-belly allowing you to see a fully visible system of organs. These nocturnal creatures are tiny — a mere 2–8 centimetres — and live in the canopies of Central and South American rain forests. When they sit still, they’re extremely difficult to spot from a distance.

<p>Glass Octopus. This ghostly octopus is found in the deep open tropical and subtropical waters around the world. Because they are so rarely captured — physically or on film — very little is known about them. Unlike their opaque cousins, these octopuses have elongated eyes that seem to be pointed perpetually upward, presumably to maximise the dim light from above.</p>
